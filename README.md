# MC_Clone

This is a reupload removing all legacy code from the previous repo and clearing up any confusion. There was very little of any of it to begin with that was not legacy/unused and I wish to not be associated as a fork/port. The two versions are now very distinct and little remains in similarity, and most of what remains I merged back, which is why those few parts are similar. But with Chunk gen code and Player code being rewritten and in an entirely different language, the last parts are being removed from the old project.
